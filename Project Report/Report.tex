	\section{Questions}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Considering the functionality of this simple proxy server, identify and discuss at least three significant limitations of your proxy server. (6 Marks)
		
		\item How could you implement potential improvements into this script to overcome
		these limitations? A flowchart or pseudocode may help to illustrate your answer. (6 marks)
		
		\item Is the proxy server using UDP or TCP sockets? How can you tell? What
		other protocols are involved?(2 marks)
		
		\item In this question, you will put together much of what you have learned about
		Internet protocols. Suppose you buy a brand new computer, connect it to Ethernet, and want to download a Web page. What are all the protocol steps that take place, starting from powering on your PC to getting the Web page? Assume there is nothing in our DNS or browser caches when you power on your PC. (Hint: the steps include the use of Ethernet, DHCP, ARP, DNS, TCP, and HTTP protocols.) Explicitly indicate in your steps how you obtain the IP and MAC addresses of a gateway router. (6 marks)
